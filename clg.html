        <p style="background-color: black; color: white; width: 80%; padding: 10px; text-align: left; font-size: 14px;">Early in <i>1964</i>, the enlightened public of Kanhangad and Nileshwar resolved to honour the memory of<b> Jawaharlal Nehru</b>, the architect of modern India by undertaking educational and cultural activities in this educationally backward area. In pursuit of this idea, a dedicated and learned team set up in 1966, an educational society known as<b> "The Nehru Memorial Education Society"</b> under the distinguished presidentship of the late <i>Shri. C. K. Nair </i>following which the society was duly registered. The establishment of Nehru Arts & Science College, Kanhangad in this backward coastal tract was the major task the society had set before themselves and had subsequently accomplished it.
